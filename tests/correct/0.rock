the dawn is persevering                                                 
your sleep is a punishment                                              
rock the darkness                                                       
let you be the dawn with the dawn                                       
let a sunrise be the dawn with you                                      

let your dream be your sleep without the dawn                           
put your dream without the dawn without the dawn into the unknown       
let a dream be the unknown without the dawn                             
let the night be something of nothing                                   
put the night into a space at the unknown

fate takes a fool and a wiseman
cast a fool into darkness
let the darkness at the night be darkness
let the night be with you
cast a wiseman into light
let the darkness at the dawn be light
let the dawn be with you

my future is for me                                                     
your future is treasure seeking                                         
let my sleep be your future with the dawn                               
let my nightmare be my sleep without your dream                         
put you with the dawn with you into me                                  
your singing is a finalizing thing                                      
let the memories be your singing with me                                
let your daydreams be the memories with me                              

fate taking my sleep, my future
fate taking your future, your singing
fate taking the memories, your daydreams

let the night be something of nothing                                   
let the dawn be a sunrise without you                                   
while your dream is bigger than the night                               
knock your dream down
let a space at your dream be the dawn without the dawn                  
put the night into excess at your dream                                 
let foes at your dream be the night                                     

thinking takes feeling, energy and thought                              
put a sunrise of energy with feeling into your mind
put thought into a space at your mind
put foes into your center
if thought is as low as the dawn
put excess into your center

put your center at feeling into my hands                                
build my hands up                                                       
put my hands into your center at feeling                                
put energy with a sunrise into place                                    
put your center at place into my center
build my center up
put my center into your center at place
if feeling is energy                                                    
put your center at a dream into my mind
build my mind up
put my mind into your center at a dream

put you without feeling into place                                      
if place is energy
put your center at the unknown into my unknown
build my unknown up
put my unknown into your center at the unknown

healing taking nothing                                                  

healing takes time
put your sleep without the dawn into the sky                            
while the sky ain't nothing
knock the sky down
put excess at the sky into your mind
if your mind is a sunrise                                               
join the darkness                                                       
shout the darkness
give back the sky                                                       

put foes at the sky into the ground
if the ground is a sunrise                                              
cast my nightmare into the shadows
put the shadows into the darkness at the night                          
join the darkness                                                       
shout the darkness
give back the sky





one is a
two is to
none is horrifying

thinking taking one, one, and one
thinking taking none, none, and two
thinking taking two, two, and one
thinking taking one, two, and two
thinking taking two, none, and one
thinking taking two, one, and two
thinking taking none, two, and one
