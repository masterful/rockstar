the dawn is persevering
your sleep is a punishment

let your dream be your sleep without the dawn
put your dream without the dawn without the dawn into the unknown
let a dream be the unknown without the dawn
let the night be something of nothing
put the night into a space at the unknown

while your dream is bigger than the night
knock your dream down
let a space at your dream be the dawn without the dawn
put the night into exes at your dream
let foes at your dream be the night


shout "done"
