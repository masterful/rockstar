## Tic Tac Toe Rockstar

This is a very simple programming exercise that implements a simple algorithm to check whether a tic-tac-toe board state has a winner, and a function to update the board state.

It is written in [rockstar](https://github.com/RockstarLang/rockstar) - a language purpose built to prevent recruiters from asking for "rockstar developers." I thought this was hilarious and decided to see if I could write something simple in the language on a Saturday. This repo is the result of those efforts.

On the plus side, I guess you could say I'm now a _certified_ rockstar programmer!


##### Notes
_I did this for jokes. Please don't think I endorse this language for anything else._
