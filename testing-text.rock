rock the night
the dawn is persevering
midnight is untroubled
let you be the dawn with the dawn

fate takes a fool and a wiseman
cast a fool into darkness
let the night at midnight be darkness
let midnight be with you
cast a wiseman into light
let the night at the dawn be light
let the dawn be with you

my future is for me
your future is treasure seeking
let my sleep be your future with the dawn
put you with the dawn with you into me
your singing is a finalizing thing
let the memories be your singing with me
let your daydreams be the memories with me

fate taking my sleep, my future
fate taking your future, your singing
fate taking the memories, your daydreams

join the night
shout the night
